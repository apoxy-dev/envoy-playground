        What's this?
    </h1>

    <p class="my-4">
        It's like <a class="underline text-purple-700" href="https://codepen.io">codepen</a> for nginx -- you paste in an nginx config, and then a server starts nginx for you and runs any <code>curl</code> or <code>http</code> command you want against
        that nginx server.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-2xl">
        Does it really run nginx?
    </h1>

    <p class="my-4">
        Yes. Every time you hit "run", it'll start an instance of nginx 1.21.
    </p>
    <h1 class="text-2xl">
        What services are running on the host?
    </h1>

    <p class="my-4">
        There's a forked version of <a href="https://github.com/mccutchen/go-httpbin"></a>go-httpbin</a>
    running on port 7777. It responds to every request by echoing back the
    method, headers, URL, and body as JSON.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-2xl">
        How's the security?
    </h1>

    <p class="my-4">
        There's no validation on what kinds of nginx configs you can use, and I'm sure there's some way to you run arbitrary code. Please don't do anything too malicious, I guess? The frontend is a static site, so all you can do is compromise a mostly stateless
        backend API server.
    </p>
    <p class="my-4">
        Your nginx runs in a separate network namespace that's disconnected from the host, so it's not able to make requests to the outside world.
    </p>
    <p class="my-4">
        I wouldn't paste anything extremely sensitive into this site, but you probably shouldn't be pasting sensitive things into random internet websites anyway :)
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-2xl">
        Where's the server code?
    </h1>

    <p class="my-4">
        I haven't open sourced it yet but here's a <a class="underline text-purple-700" href="https://gist.github.com/jvns/edf78e7775fea8888685a9a2956bc477">gist of the main server code</a>, so you can see basically what it does. It probably has a lot
        of bugs right now. It's running on fly.io. </p>

    <h1 class="text-2xl">
        Who made it?
